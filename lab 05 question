# Given three numbers x, y, z, determine if one of them is the sum of the other two. 
# If so, print the equation, otherwise print "None found". For example, if x = 2,
# y = 1, and z = 3, print "z = x + y". If there are multiple possibilities (such as
# all values equal to 0) favor the solutions in this order: "x = y + z", "y = x + z",
# and "z = x + y".

x = 0 
y = 0 
z = 0 


if x==y+z:
   print("x=y+z ")
elif y==x+z:
   print("y=x + z")
elif z==x+y:
   print("z=x + y")
elif x==y==z:
   print("Nothing found")
